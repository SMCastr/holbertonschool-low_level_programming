## Description

This project is designed to help you understand and implement two fundamental search algorithms:

1. **Linear Search:** A simple search algorithm that iterates through an array and checks each element sequentially to find a target value.

2. **Binary Search:** A more efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays that divides the array in half and eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step.

The project also includes answers to questions about the time and space complexity (Big O notation) of these algorithms.

## Project Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `0-linear.c`: Contains the implementation of the Linear Search algorithm.
- `1-binary.c`: Contains the implementation of the Binary Search algorithm.
- `search_algos.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
- `2-O`, `3-O`, `4-O`, `5-O`, `6-O`: Text files with answers to Big O notation questions.

## Usage
You can run the search algorithms and test them with the provided main programs. Here's an example of how to use them:

Linear Search : .0/-linear
Binary Search: ./1-binary

## Big O Notation
Answer to the Big O notations questions are provided in the following files:

2-O: Time complexity (worst case) of a Linear Search.
3-O: Space complexity (worst case) of an interative Linear Search.
4-O: Time complexity (worst case) of Binary Search.
5-O: Space complexity (worst case) of a Binary Search.
6-O: Space complexity of the "allocate_map" fucntion.

## How to Compile

To compile the C files and test the search algorithms, you can use the provided compilation commands:

## Bash
$- gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-linear.c -o 0-linear
$- gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 1-main.c 1-binary.c -o 1-binary
